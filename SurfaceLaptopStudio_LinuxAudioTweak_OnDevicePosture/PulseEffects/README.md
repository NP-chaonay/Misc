## General Remark

**Important Annoucement (refer from README of SurfaceLaptopStudio_LinuxAudioTweak_OnDevicePosture): Since my SLS right speaker is in broken state (treble sound not work but mid-range work), so from now on (18/7/22) I will only do test/tweak by using left speaker. And any testing/tweaking config that tested from only left speaker will be placed in Only1CH folder. I mostly sure that it is hardware problem not firmware/driver. However stereo testing/tweaking outside contribution is still weclomed. However anything that not depends on difference between mono/stereo testing/tweaking will placed in the normal place not in the folder 'Only1CH'. So this mean that many files in here will be outdated/not-touched due to that reason.**

See CONFIG_EXPLAIN for more information about configuration explanation.

Notice that all config files in folder (excluding ones in subfolder) is discontinued. See CONFIG_EXPLAIN for more info.

## Tips
- try this command ```pulseeffects -b 1``` to bypass audio effect and ```-b 2``` to revert. This help to hear the difference.
- If you not sure if what you are doing that conflict this is better or not know what you are doing or know the result or how is done: Please follow PulseEffects guide on "Enhancing your internal notebook speakers without using an equalizer" instead of only EQ adjustment. If you dont have enough better reason, then perhaps it is better to stick to that doc.
