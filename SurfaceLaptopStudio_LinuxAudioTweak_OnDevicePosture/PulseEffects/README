[why section]
- Why put like this order EQ>Loudness>Compressor>Limiter:
	- The input audio is nothing normal but we need to apply EQ to make it optimize with device posture
	- So we do EQ first (assume that orignal audio is good)
	- And then we pass to Loudness (idk but I think this will do loudness stuff work to make it not so loud/quiet, idk)
	- Compressor (idk it seem to be popular plugin, that use before export or mix with another track, idk about this too)
	- Limiter as last to make sure there is no hard-clip in output audio
