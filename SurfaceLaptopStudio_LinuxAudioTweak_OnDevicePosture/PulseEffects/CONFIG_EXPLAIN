[why section]
- Why put like this order EQ>Loudness>Compressor>Limiter:
	- The input audio is nothing normal but we need to apply EQ to make it optimize with device posture
	- So we do EQ (using 10band, then recalculate freq, then adjust each band it, also adjust output dB as final, leave else as default) first (assume that orignal audio is good)
	- And then we pass to Loudness (leave all default) (idk but I think this will do loudness stuff work to make it not so loud/quiet, idk)
	- Compressor (using default value) (idk it seem to be popular plugin, that use before export or mix with another track, idk about this too)
		- Noted that this is disabled as now, because I have designed output of EQ to not much exceed 0db, so no this plugin to make sound quality better, and this seem to decrease volume so disable it, as my EQ implementation also decrease it already.
	- Limiter (using default value but enable 2 auto features) as last to make sure there is no hard-clip in output audio
- I think it is better to using 0db as both input/output dB in plugin EQ, and lower in EQ curve instead. so the maximum peek of EQ curve must be 0dB. So the sound will not much over-amp/under-amp and so make it not be quality-reduced.
	- The disadvantage of this method and alike is the decrement of many band cause overall volume decreased (especially when EQ curve have many band's value that much dfferent value from highest peak), and maybe have implementation that do not decrease overall volume while retain quality and EQ curve.
	- So if we cannot find or implement way of using better EQ/method, then I may need to using this instead, it make audio becoming less loud but at least gurrantee of audio quality will not be loss.
	- maybe our answer is on compressor stuff and something I don't know (I currently don't have that much audio processing/production knowledge), maybe we need EQ that able to adjust each band in special way, for ex. no -1,0+2dB, but just re-mapping dB value in range of (-inf,0dB) not above than that, so we can amp any high-loudness of specific band to be more higher but not >0dB, while some loudness range we adjust little bit and lower range we leave it. This possible on some kind of EQ, but I do not know what is this called, or does I have to do it by myself, however I do not know about audio processing and math that involved (certainly Calculus).
