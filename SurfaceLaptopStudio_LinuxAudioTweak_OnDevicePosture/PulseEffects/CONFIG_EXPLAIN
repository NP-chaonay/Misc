[why section]
- Why put like this order EQ>Loudness>Compressor>Limiter:
	- The input audio is nothing normal but we need to apply EQ to make it optimize with device posture
	- So we do EQ (using 10band, then recalculate freq, then adjust each band it, also adjust output dB as final, leave else as default) first (assume that orignal audio is good)
	- And then we pass to Loudness (leave all default) (idk but I think this will do loudness stuff work to make it not so loud/quiet, idk)
	- Compressor (using default value) (idk it seem to be popular plugin, that use before export or mix with another track, idk about this too)
		- Noted that this is disabled as now, because I have designed output of EQ to not much exceed 0db, so no this plugin to make sound quality better, and this seem to decrease volume so disable it, as my EQ implementation also decrease it already.
	- Limiter (using default value but enable 2 auto features) as last to make sure there is no hard-clip in output audio
- I think it is better to reduce output dB in plugin EQ, according to maximum peek of EQ curve. So the sound will not much over-amp and make it be quality-reduced later when passing through Limiter (Just like bass boosted, when it passed Limiter to do soft clipping, the shape of sound is changed)
	- The disadvantage of this is when some freq is gone very high than other else, we have low-volume output sound, so maybe we have to using other EQ adjustment / method of EQ adjustment / or even method of audio improvement
	- So if we cannot find or implement way of using better EQ/method, then I may need to using this instead, it make audio becoming less loud but at least gurrantee of audio quality will not be loss.
	- maybe our answer is on compressor stuff and something I don't know (I currently don't have that much audio processing/production knowledge), maybe we need EQ that able to adjust each band in special way, for ex. no -1,0+2dB, but just re-mapping dB value in range of (-inf,0dB) not above than that, so we can amp any high-loudness of specific band to be more higher but not >0dB, while some loudness range we adjust little bit and lower range we leave it. This possible on some kind of EQ, but I do not know what is this called, or does I have to do it by myself, however I do not know about audio processing and math that involved (certainly Calculus).
	- Better my way I think it is better is to, (1) adjust EQ in normal way (2) ensure that center of the curve is sit at 0db (3) set output db to -(value of highest dB that existed in each band)
		- Formula for (2) uses in Python:
			- max=(highest dB value in each band); min=(same as max but lowest, also keep negative value if it have); c=max-(max-min)/2
			- c is the value needs to subtract every band's dB value (if c is negative then it will be X-c and will become X+|c|)
